## Reflection

The main purpose of this project is to create a React application from scratch without using `create-react-app`. Instead, a webpack was introduced. Apart from that, some additional packages and configurations were added and setted up, such as `Eslint`, `Prettier`, `Stylelint`, `Babel`, `Typescript`, `Webpack` itself, `pre-commit hooks`, `github actions`, etc.

The project itself is not something fancy and complex. Consist of simple page with Header and main part and applied styled, because the main puppose was to acttually set up project from scratch, set up needed enviroment, etc.

During development phase of this project, I was able to set up a project enviroment from scratch, get familiar with webpack, webserver, loaders, needed npm packeges to set up a project enviroment, git and github flow and deploy project on `Github Pages

The main challenges that I faced were related to setuping project from scratch, finding and implementing different approaches and solutions, hooking up webpack with another packeges, configurating `Eslint`, `Prettier`, `Stylelint`, `Babel`, `Typescript`, `Webpack`,  `pre-commit hooks`, `github actions`, etc.

Techologies, tools and stack: `React`, `Typescript`, `Sass`, `Eslint`, `Prettier`, `Stylelint`, `Babel`, `Husky`, `Github Actions`.
